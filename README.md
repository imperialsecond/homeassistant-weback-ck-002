This custom HomeAssistant integration adds support for CK-002 thermostats via WeBack.

To use, first register your thermostats through the WeBack app.

This was tested with "Swarey" branded thermostats. The PCB says "CK-002-V3.0".

Note: This is a proof of concept. In particular, you cannot make any changes to your thermostat
configuration.

## Configuration

Add the custom component to your HomeAssistant directory and then configure it through the UI.
